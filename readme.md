# Developer's BFF
A tool for web developers that includes two generators: one for fake text and one for fake users.

Submitted as a project for the course Dynamic Web Applications.

## Project Requirements
I fulfilled the following requirements that are specific to P3:

* __Package Use__: I used the package copycat by Github user gitlov to scrape some websites for first and last names, which I used to populate the files for random user names.

## Highlights
To create the word list for the lorem ipsum generator, I used Wordlist Maker to turn the text of _Frankenstein_ into a list of words with no duplicates in all lowercase.
