# Developer's BFF
A tool for web developers that includes two generators: one for fake text and one for fake users.

Submitted as a project for the course Dynamic Web Applications.

Minor correction to demo video: I tried to use the scraper package to pull names for the user generator (not for the lorem generator).

## Package Used
Project 3 requires use of a package. To fulfill that requirement, I used the package Faker by Github user fzaninotto to create first and last names for the users generator.

## Highlights
To create the word list for the lorem ipsum generator, I used Wordlist Maker to turn the text of _Frankenstein_ into a list of words with no duplicates in all lowercase.

I was having trouble debugging my Lorem generator. A friend of mine with more coding experience saw my code and suggested a break it apart into multiple functions. This taught me a valuable lesson: If you can't see your entire loop on a single screen, it's very difficult to debug.
